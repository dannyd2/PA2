Implementation of Go-Back-N

A version of the Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol which facilitates the
transfer of a text file from one host to another across an unreliable network. The protocol should be
able to handle packet/ACK losses. For simplicity, we do not consider delayed packets; that is, a packet
is received almost immediately after it is sent, or not at all.
